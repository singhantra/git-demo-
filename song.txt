1. Nothing Gold Can Stay
FAMOUS POEM

Top 10032
 By Robert Frost
Nature's first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf's a flower;
But only so an hour.

2. A Fallen Leaf
FAMOUS POEM

 By Ella Wheeler Wilcox
A trusting little leaf of green,
A bold audacious frost;
A rendezvous, a kiss or two,
And youth for ever lost.
